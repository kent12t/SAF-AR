# Targets Directory

Place your MindAR target file in this directory as `targets.mind`.

## Creating a Target File

1. Choose a high-contrast image to use as your AR marker
2. Go to the MindAR Image Compiler: https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile
3. Upload your image
4. Download the compiled `.mind` file
5. Rename it to `targets.mind` and place it in this directory

## Target Image Tips

- Use images with distinct features and high contrast
- Avoid repetitive patterns
- Avoid reflective or transparent surfaces
- Images with text, logos, or distinct shapes work well
- Test your target with the MindAR testing tool: https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/test

## Testing Without a Target

You can use the "Test Mode" toggle in the application to test your models without a target image. This is useful for development and testing model placement.
